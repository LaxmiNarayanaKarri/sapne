      & Women Empowerment centre “SHAKTI”- power to attain anything, in Delhi itself. We believe 
      empowering women is a key to building a brighter and progressive future. 
      Till date SAPNE has benefitted 10,000 women and wish to serve more.</p>

      <p id="whoi">Empowerment of women is a necessity for the very 
      development of a society, since it enhances both the quality and the quantity of human
       resources available for development. Empowering women is the fundamental right of women.
        Women empowerment is the needed one for today's world. Women Empowerment is made up of 
        two words women and empowerment.
       Empowerment means to give power or authority to someone.</p>

      <p id="whoi">So, Women Empowerment means power in the hands of women.
       It signifies that women should be given equal opportunity in every field,
        irrespective of any discrimination. An empowered woman is a seeker. She takes 
        steps to discover her life purpose and dedicates herself to living in a way that aligns
         with it. She knows that living her purpose will bring meaning and fulfillment to
       her own life, while improving the lives of those around her.</p>

      development of underprivileged women and girls. Sapne provides them various 
      services like medical assistance (sanitation and nutrition), legal assistance and by

      self-defence, classical dance, and more such relevant skills. Project Shakti aims at women empowerment. 
      Women empowerment is the pivotal part in any society, state, or country. It is a woman who plays a dominant 
      role in the basic life of a child. Women are an important section of our society. Education as means of 
      empowerment of women can bring about a positive attitudinal change in our society.</p>
